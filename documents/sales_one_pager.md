# SentinelAI: The Future of Security

## Executive Summary
Security isn't about watching screens—it's about actionable intelligence. SentinelAI transforms your existing camera infrastructure into a proactive security guard that never sleeps, blinks, or gets tired.

## The Problem
- **Human Error:** Security operators miss 95% of screen activity after just 20 minutes of monitoring.
- **High Costs:** 24/7 human guarding is expensive and unscalable.
- **Reactive:** Traditional CCTV is only useful *after* a crime has occurred.

## The SentinelAI Solution
We use state-of-the-art Generative AI (Gemini 2.5) to analyze video feeds in real-time.
1.  **Instant Detection:** Identifies weapons, fights, or unauthorized access instantly.
2.  **Natural Language Search:** "Find the man in the red jacket from 2 PM."
3.  **Hardware Agnostic:** Works with the IP cameras you already own.
